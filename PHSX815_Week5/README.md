Input: -N (number of subintervals) -a (start bound) -b (end bound)

Output: Trapezoidal rule plot, area under curve approximation; Gaussian Quadrature approximation, error.


Function currently integrated is sin(4x)^2. User will have to explicitly change line 89 to test different function.
Also make note that the "accepted value" is similarly tailored to this function. See lines 41-45 for editing purposes.
